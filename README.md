# slsa-demo
A demo of SLSA functionality

## Level 1

> **The build process must be fully scripted/automated and generate
> provenance.** Provenance is metadata about how an artifact was built,
> including the build process, top-level source, and dependencies. Knowing the
> provenance allows software consumers to make risk-based security decisions.
> Provenance at SLSA 1 does not protect against tampering, but it offers a basic
> level of code source identification and can aid in vulnerability management.

Source: [https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels#detailed-explanation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels#detailed-explanation)

Detailed requirements:

### Build
- [Scripted build](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#scripted-build)

### Provenance
- [Available](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#available)

Demo: Create a new tag, e.g., `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "v0.1.0"` and push it to
GitHub. This will trigger a GitHub Action that will build the source and
generate a provenance file. The provenance file will be uploaded together with
the resulting binary.

## Level 2

> **Requires using version control and a hosted build service that generates
> authenticated provenance.** These additional requirements give the software
> consumer greater confidence in the origin of the software. At this level, the
> provenance prevents tampering to the extent that the build service is trusted.
> SLSA 2 also provides an easy upgrade path to SLSA 3.

Detailed requirements:

Same as 1, plus:

### Build
- [Build service](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#build-service)

### Provenance
- [Authenticated](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#authenticated) - The
  provenance is signed by the build service in a way that allows the consumer to
  verify that it has not been tampered with.
- [Service generated](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#service-generated)
  - The provenance is generated by the build service, not directly by e.g. a
    developer.

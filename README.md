# slsa-demo
A demo of SLSA functionality

## Level 1

> **The build process must be fully scripted/automated and generate
> provenance.** Provenance is metadata about how an artifact was built,
> including the build process, top-level source, and dependencies. Knowing the
> provenance allows software consumers to make risk-based security decisions.
> Provenance at SLSA 1 does not protect against tampering, but it offers a basic
> level of code source identification and can aid in vulnerability management.
